See the Badge beside each phase name for the weighting of the assignments during that phase.</p> <p>In the first phase we are trying to really get to the root of the problem that is needed to be solved for the client.</p> <p>In the second phase we are designing the interface and optimizing what will become the user experience in the app.</p> <p>The third phase is all about doing the development work of turning the designs and prototypes into a functioning app, while doing iterative development and testing.</p> <p>The final phase is about wrapping up the final development on the required features, working on a deployment plan, documentation, and handing the completed project off to the client.</p> <h2 id="course-outline"><a href="#course-outline" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Course Outline</h2> <p><a href="/mad9145-w19/2018-2019_mad9145.pdf">MAD9145 Course Outline PDF</a></p> <h2 id="team-identity"><a href="#team-identity" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Team Identity</h2> <p>Your first deliverable is the <a href="/docs/modules/assignments/identity.html">Team Identity</a> assignment.

These meetings will be held in the DARE District in room C278. Each team will have a 30 minute window for their meeting.</p> <p>Some of these meetings will be where you submit deliverables. Some will give you an opportunity to ask questions that are specific to your team's project.</p> <p>Attendance at these meetings is required for all team members.</p> <p>We will randomly select the time slot for each team using this:
