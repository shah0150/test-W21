# Agile Methodology

## The Agile Manifesto

Back in 2001 a bunch of middle-aged white guys with a huge amount of collective experience in development projects got together to see if they could come up with a better way of managing software projects.

The result was the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/). If you look at their website it quickly becomes clear that these guys were experienced developers, not designers.

This manifesto is made up of 4 Values and 12 Principles that are meant to guide a philosophy of understanding. It is not a set of rules or software tools. It is an approach and a mindset.

## The 4 Values

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.

**Working software** over comprehensive documentation.

**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.

**Responding to change** over following a plan.

## The 12 Principles

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.

8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
