# Deployment Document

The deployment document is something that you will provide to your client as well as submit to your instructors.

The audience for the document is a technically saavy one.

Approach this as a manual written for another development team to explain the work that has been done so far, the features that have been completed, the features that are planned, links to project assets online, details of any accounts and credentials that are required for the app or website, and a detailed list of all the project assets and how they fit together.

The document should be written in a way that you could give it to another team in class and after reading it they should be able to continue the work on your project.

Consider the document to be confidential.

## Suggested Document Sections

### Introduction

A brief introduction and explaination of what your project is, what problem is was trying to solve and the main elements in your solution. Think of this as a written version of what you would tell visitors to your booth on RE/ACTION Day.

### Required Features

Insert a copy of your Required Features document as the first main section of this document. It should clearly indicate which features are currently complete and which ones should be part of the next version.

### Credentials and Accounts

Details of the URLs where the usernames, keys, and passwords are to be used.

## APIs

Explainations of all the external APIs that are used in the project.

Provide a detailed explaination of the purpose of each API, the security requirements, URLs, endpoints, and credentials for the API. If online documentation for the API is readily available and well written, you may provide a link to that documentation instead of re-writing all of it.
