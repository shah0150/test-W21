# Client Midterm Presentation

## In Class

During the class following the reading week each team will present their interactive visual mockup, talk about what the client's problem was and explain the reasoning behind your solution. A summary of the features that will be part of the first two sprints should be included as well as any features that you will not be able to complete before Re/Action Day.

The presentation should only take about 15 minutes.

Each team member should take part in the presentation.

Think of this as a dry run for presenting it to your client.

There will be a question period after each presentation. The question period will last roughly 5 minutes. The questions will come from classmates as well as your instructors.

Your team will receive grades for your presentation.

We will let you know if it is ready to present to the client or if we have recommended changes.

## During Status Meeting

During the status meeting we would like to see the full range of materials that you are going to present to your clients. This includes the required features document, slide deck, interactive visual mockup with any changes noted during the presentation.
