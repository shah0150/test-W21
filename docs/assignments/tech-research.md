# Technology Research

This is the result of the research that you scoped in Week 3.

There should be a reference document that includes the list of technologies and the results of your research on these topics. Create the document as a how-to guide for your team mates.

Additionally, you should have a PUBLIC repo for each proof of concept that you reference in your document. This is what the team will use to share knowledge with each other.

Please submit the link to your document and make sure your document includes links to the public repos for each technology.
