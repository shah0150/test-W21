# Research and Proof of Concept

There is a deliverable in February showing the results of your research into technologies that will be needed for your project as well as some code proof of concepts.

During Week 3 you should be compiling a list of the technology that you think you might need and determining which of these you know and which ones you need to research. Basically, you are going to scope out what needs to be done for the February Assignment (./tech-research.md)

Present your list during the team status meeting in Week 3.
