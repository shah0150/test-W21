# Development Demos

These are the demos that you perform during the status meetings on the three Thursdays before RE/Action Day.

On each Thursday, during the status meeting, the team needs to present a demo of the latest version of their app and/or website.

Recommendations for fixes will be made each week.

Progress in the features will be expected each week.

Please bring a copy of your required features list as part of the demo to compare against your app.
