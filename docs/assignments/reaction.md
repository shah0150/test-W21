# RE/ACTION DAY

RE/ACTION Day is the presentation to the public of your culminating project work in the program.

All team members need to attend and talk with visitors to your booth.

There will be judging done of all the projects and prizes given to the projects that best impress the judges.

There will be a brief time during the evening before the day to do some basic setup at the booths. Do not leave any valuables at the booth during this time.

The booth area will be open around 7am - 8am for you to finish your set-up. The judging typically begins around 8am. Public usually starts to attend around 9am. By 2pm the day is over and the winners are announced.

Since this is a long day, not all team members need to stay the whole time.

Everyone in the team should be there until the judges have come by your booth (by around 9am). After that, and until 2pm, make sure that you always have 3 people at your booth to talk with people and answer questions. Each team can make their own schedule for who is at the booth for the rest of the day.

## Devices

We will be lending devices out to teams on Tuesday April 9th before RE/ACTION day. Please send an email to Steve and Su Cheng letting us know if you need an Android or iOS device. We need to make sure that all teams have enough devices. Keep this in mind when asking for multiple devices.

Three devices should be sufficient for any demos that you do. One per person working the booth.

Devices should be returned to T-127 on Friday, when you shut down your booth for the day.

## Attire and Behaviour

Dress well for the event. Treat it like a job interview. If you prefer, teams will sometimes create T-shirts for the event, or wear a similar thing.

Do not eat while at the booth. Walk away from the booth to take a break and eat.
