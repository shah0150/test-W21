# Client Responses

During your initial client meeting you will want your full team to be present.

The meeting will be to gather as much information about the project as you can, as well as to provide information to the client which will make them start to think about the process of designing and building the project deliverables. Your client will understand their own business but this could be their first experience with app development.

If your client does have prior design or development experience then try to use that to your advantage. Ask a lot of questions about how they would approach the project. You will have plenty of opportunities to impress them with your work later on.

Following your initial client meeting, please submit a Word Document or PDF that includes the list of questions that you asked your client as well as their responses to each.

Also include, in the document, a list of all attendees at the meeting (both client and team), and the location or method of meeting. Eg: In person in the Algonquin Student Commons, Online via Skype, etc.
