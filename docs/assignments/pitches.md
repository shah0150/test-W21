# Elevator Pitches

On the Tuesday before RE/ACTION Day, during class, each person needs to do an elevator pitch about their project. The whole team will come to the front of the class and then each person will do their own pitch about the project that is **1 minute or less**.

Each person on the team can give the same or similar presentation or use the same script.

The idea is for you to be able to express to a booth visitor, very quickly:

- What was the purpose of your project.
- What was the problem that you are trying to solve.
- How did you solve the problem.
- Why is your solution better than other possible solutions.

Keep in mind that it is impossible to explain everything about your app in 30 seconds. What you want to do is interest the listener enough that they will start to ask questions.

Each person will receive an individual grade on how effectively they answered those points listed above.
