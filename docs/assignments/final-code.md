# Final Code Submission

The Github repo needs to have your client added. If your client does not have a GitHub account, you can create one for them and just provide them with the login credentials.

The original repo should be left with access for everyone in the team as well as your instructors.

The client can fork the repo or clone the repo to start making changes. The original one is for the students to be able to show work that they have done.
