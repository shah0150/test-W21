# BUG FIXES

Please submit a list of known bugs and missing features as well as the timeline to fix each before the end of the semester.

If there are going to be features that you cannot implement before the final hand-off or non-critical bugs that you will not be able to fix.

This information will have to be provided to the client as part of the deployment document.
