# Data Structures

Every project needs to store information. The general questions about the data that we are trying to answer are:

1. What format(s) will your data be stored in: json file; MySQL database; csv file; localStorage; SQLite; a document database?
2. Where will the data be stored: client-side; server-side?
3. What fields will be required, or what objects need to be saved? Eg: user information, account information, payment information, etc.
4. What data needs to be transmitted between the client-side and the server-side, and in which direction?
5. What APIs are being used to transmit data between elements of the solution?
6. Where are APIs being called from: client-side; server-side?

## Data in Motion vs Static Data

Some data will be stored in a certain location and left there, usually on the client side. Some data is stored in one location but gets transmitted back and forth. The documents 
 
This assignment will likely be several documents. You can create ERD (electronic Relationship Diagrams) using MySQL Workbench. You can create sample JSON or XML files. You can create spreadsheets with sample data. You can create Google/Word docs or PDFs that give written explainations of how the data is comprised and used.

The point of this exercise is to get you to think about what data will be used, where it will be used, when it will be used and how it will be used.

If you are using private or proprietary APIs, include notes about that in your documents.

At the end of this exercise you should have a collection of information that anyone on the team can review and understand the data storage and data flow requirements of your project solution.
