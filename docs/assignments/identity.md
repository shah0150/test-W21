# Team Identity

## Description

Each team needs to create some branding for their own team. This will include:

1. A Team Name
2. A Team Logo

Think of your team as a mobile development company that has been hired by your client to complete their project. 

The name and logo that your team creates will be used on reports and in the demonstration poster on Applied Research Day in April.

## Submission

Submit your logo through BS LMS as a file attachment and the team name as a comment on the submission.
