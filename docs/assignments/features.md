# Required Features

This will be a document that your instructors must approve before it goes to the client.

It needs to be a detailed list of the platforms and features that you are going to commit to completing for Applied Research Day. Time after Applied Research Day will be allowed for bug fixes and updates before client hand-off.

## The Features Must be Ranked

Use the following terms for ranking the features.

1. Version One Core Feature
2. Version One Desirable Feature
3. Version Two Core Recommended Feature
4. Version Two Desirable Feature

With this ranking you are spelling out to the client what you are committing to for this initial version of the solution, but you are not discounting or dismissing features. You are pointing out that they will need to be added in a future version.

Along with the ranking of the features you will need to have your [Visual Mockup](./mockup.md) to present to the client. The visual Mockup will allow you to demonstrate all the features that are ranked 1. or 2.
